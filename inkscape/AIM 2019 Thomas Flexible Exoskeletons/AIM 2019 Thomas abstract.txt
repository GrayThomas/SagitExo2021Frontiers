Exoskeletons are devices designed to assist a human operator by amplifying their strength. However, their benefit to the operator depends heavily on the amount by which they can increase to power to weight ratio once the operator dons the exoskeleton. With today’s technology toolkit of electric motors, aluminum structures, ball bearing joints, and 3D printed plastic cuffs, this power to weight ratio can increase very slightly or not at all. In this poster I introduce some mechanical design ideas that exploit the potential of flexible robots to address this problem. The ideas I propose here attempt to remove structure from the joints, increase the load-bearing potential of the joint cuffs, and allow a sliding scale of transmitting forces through the human’s existing joint structure or through the exoskeleton.
