Introducion of 1.5 page is by all means too long, and it is not easy to follow. some paragraphs are also too long, and the way the work of others is presented is sometimes confusing.

I like the idea that the main contribution of the paper is already given in the first paragraph, after short intro. but this, followed by 1.5 page to go through the literature makes it confusing what is actually the contribution of this paper. 

I suggest to clearly outline the contribution, and then give a short overview of the state of the art in terms of the main aspects of your contribution. there is no need to elaborate on so many different works in such a detail.

this needs to be rephrased, as now it is comparing compliance of the exoskeleton port with a controller, which makes no sense.

my understanding is that the authors want to say that the environment side of the exoskeleton can be made more compliant using force-based controller compared to a simple position controller. however, the sentence is certainly not saying this

the expected Fz force is the thing of VI-D.3 experiment, but the arrow is crossing both D.2 and D.3 experiment Fz graphs. if the arrow has nothing to do with D.2 it needs to be removed from the 2nd column. if, on the other hand, it does related somehow D.2 and D.3, this needs to be explained in the caption of the figure (if I am not mistaken on what the authors want to show, would not simply a vertical arrow from the measured to the expected Fz in D.3 suffice? it would certainly make the plot clearer)

signs of joint angles and torques/forces need to be clearly defined. e.g. is ankle flexion positive or negative?

also, I suggest you move this legend off the graphs as this will allow a decrease in y-axis of the torque graph and thus better quality (easier-to-read) graphs

are all these angles relevant for the point you are trying to make? as it is now, it is very hard to read these graphs.

maybe only focus on the most important joint angles and torque? or just the ones that are changing the most? there is no point in showing all these trajectories if most of them remain unchanged. just mention somehwere in the text or figure caption that all other trajectories not shown do not change.

what is the cause of the sudden change in the hip and knee joints' FE angles?

is this the half-squat show in the video? if so, please do mention that here and provide any further explanations needed

I find it hard to understand that the weight of the exoskeleton was felt by the user (captured by the sensor), while adding extra weight to the exoskeleton was not captured by the sensor, although you claim was felt by the user. can you discuss more on this? 

further, did the user confirm that the weight was actually felt in Z axis?

the torque in the seconds 10-30 does not seem to be ``a rough continuation''. similar, albeit to a lesser degree, is true in the seconds 20-30. can the authors comment on this? is this a consequence of different joint angles (body position), or errors in calculations, or both?

also re-phrase, as ``weightings Q1 and Q2 matrix'' does not sound well

I find this figure very hard to read.

for one, the background should probably be white so as to make the colours stand out.

further, it is hard to read all the torques and forces even with when zoomed on a pc; this would be impossible to understand in the printed version.

one option would be to remove all forces/torques/frames that do not add a lot to the point the authors are trying to make
