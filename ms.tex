\begin{abstract}
Augmenting the physical strength of a human operator during unpredictable human-directed (volitional) movements is a relevant capability for several proposed exoskeleton applications, including mobility augmentation, manual material handling, and tool operation. 
Unlike controllers and augmentation systems designed for repetitive tasks (e.g. walking), we approach physical strength augmentation by a task-agnostic method of force amplification---using force/torque sensors at the human--machine interface to estimate the human task force, and then amplifying it with the robot.	
Coupled stability of the machine with the human motivates our introduction of an amplification shaping framework for the design of bandwidth-limited controllers.
To avoid system identification of the operator wearing the exoskeleton, we refine the amplification strategy down to a one-parameter tunable compensator.
This amplification controller is integrated into a complete framework for controlling exoskeletons \ta{that} includes human-led foot transitions, inequality constraints, and a computationally efficient prioritization.
A powered lower-body exoskeleton is used to demonstrate behavior of the control framework in a lab environment.

\section*{Acknowledgment}
	For this research in human strength amplification, Apptronik Systems Inc. provided, at no cost, access to their exoskeleton hardware called Sagit-P5. They also provided mechanical maintenance and improvements to the low level interfaces to facilitate the testing. The authors would like to thank Donghyun Kim for providing insights on contact transitions. This system was designed and built by a team including Jonas Fox, Brad Resh, Uday Savaria, Ryan Harkins, Ryan MacWilliams, Joel Cox, and Paul Fleury. The authors would also like to acknowledge Bill Helmsing and Jeff Cardenas for allocating time for our research on the Sagit-P5 exoskeleton.
